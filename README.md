Point Class:

  Supports many useful features, including:
  ~ Accepts three different constructors! Use the default, make a point with a dimension, or even pass it 
    an array and a size for easy point constructing.
  
  ~ Use an assignment operator (=) to make one point exactly like another! Only different!
  
  ~ Points support arithmetic! (Use +, -, *, and /, just don't divide by zero!)
  
  ~ Use compound operators to save time and typing (+=, -=, *=, and /= all supported)
  
  ~ Compare points using two awesome comparison operators (== and != supported)
  
Cluster Class:

  It's getting there!
